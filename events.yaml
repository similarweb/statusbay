      Pod failed to pass readiness probe:
      <ul>
        <li>Examine the Pod's readiness check to see what's the "ready" criteria, try to run the check yourself.</li>
        <li>Make sure the readiness check isn't timing out.</li>
        <li>Once readiness probe failed after it was marked healthy, Kubernetes won't restart the Pod, you'll need to redeploy your application for the readiness.</li>
